            There are six data types in Javascript which is divided into three main categories:
            <br/>
            - Primitive (Primary) which are String, Number, and Boolean
            <br/>
            - Composite (Reference) which are Object, Array, and Function
            <br/>
            - Special data types which are Undefined and Null 
            <br/>
            1. Strings
            <br/>
            The string data type is used to represent textual data Strings are created using single or double quotes surrounding one or more characters
            <br/>
            eg:
                var b = 'He said "sayonara" and left for his 2 month expedition.';
                o/p He said "sayonara" and left for his 2 month expedition.
            <br/>
            2. Number
            <br/>
            The number data type is used to represent positive or negative numbers with or without decimal place, or numbers written using exponential notation
            <br/>
            eg:
                var a = 264; 
                o/p 264
            <br/>
            3.Boolean
            <br/>
            The Boolean data type can hold only two values: true or false.
            <br/>
            eg:
                var isReading = true;
                o/p true
            <br/>
            4. Object 
            <br/>
            The object is a complex data type that allows you to store collections of data
            <br/>
            eg :
                var person = {"name": "jacques", "surname": "Kallis", "age": "44"}
            <br/>
            5. Array
            <br/>
            An array is a type of object used for storing multiple values in single variable. Uses [ ]
            <br/>
            eg: 
                [1, 2 ,3,52,14]
            <br/>
            6. Functions
            <br/>
            The function is callable object that executes a block of code. Since functions are objects, so it is possible to assign them to variables
            <br/>
            eg:
                var greeting = function(){ 
                    return "have a good day sir/madam"; 
                }
                alert(typeof greeting) // Output: function
                alert(greeting()); // Output: Have a good day sir/madam 
            7. Undefined
            <br/>
            The undefined data type can only have one value-the special value undefined. If a variable has been declared, but has not been assigned a value, has the value undefined.
            <br/>
            eg:
                var t;
                alert(t) // Output: undefined
            <br/>
            8. Null
            <br/>
            This is another special data type that can have only one value-the null value. A null value means that there is no value. It is not equivalent to an empty string ("") or 0, it is simply nothing.
            <br/>
            eg:
                b = null;
                alert(b) // Output: null
