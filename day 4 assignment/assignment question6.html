    <h1>Question 6:
        Rewrite the function using '?' or '||'
        Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the visitor enters another number – ask them
        to input again.
        The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number greater than 100 or cancels the
        input/enters an empty line.
        Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. There’s no need to implement a special
        handling for a non-numeric input in this task.</h1>

    let num;
do {
  num = prompt("Enter a number greater than 100?", 0);
} while (num <= 100 && num);
console.log(num);
